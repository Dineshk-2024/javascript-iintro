java script is a scripting programming language and for web interactivity.
web interactivity means some kind of action.

programming language---1. object oriented programming language 
                       2. functional procedure oriented programming language 
                       3. scripting programming language

java script is a loosely typed programming language and not strictly typed and dynamic typed programming language and lite weight programming language.
for example:- 
      java             \\          javascript
 int eid=101;                     var eid=101
double esal=45000.00;            var esal=45000.00
string ename="rahul"             var ename="rahul";
[;]mandatory for java            [;] not mandatory for java script.
to declare one variable{eid=101;} type{int,var,double} is important. 
=============================================================================================================================== 
java script is a dynamic typed:-
for example:-
in java eid="soniya"; it will comes compile time error because java is a static typed programming language. 
in js eid="soniya"; its going to work in java script because it is dynamic typed programming language any time we can change the type.
================================================================================================================================
java script is a lite weight typed:-
for example:-
one.py         // one.java                    // one.js
a=19              class test{                    var a=10
b=11              p s v m (...)                  var b=20
print(a+b)        int a=10;                      console.log(a+b)
                  int b=10;
                  system.output.println(a+b)
                  }
**for execute python file we required python software.
**for execute java file we required java software to installed the java s/w we get JDK JRE.
**for execute java script we not required software we required only browser ,browser is enough to execute your javascript file...
=======================================================================================================================================
windows- default browser is edge browser..
linux- default browser is mozilla firefox..
mac- default browser is safari..

every browser internally there is one java script engine 
every browser understand html and runs the java script code because every browser having internally one java script is there...
engine names:-
for chrome = V8 engine.
for mozilla firefox = spider monkey
for edge = Chakra
for safari = javascript core...
================================================================================================================================
java script is based on interpreter :-

there are twotypes compiler programming language and interpreter programming language...
compiler Pl:-  // interpreter PL:-
java              javascript
typescript        python
c++               

it is just a one kind of software convert from high level code to low level binary code processor will understand only 0 and 1s
compiler means compilazation,interpreter means execution ...both are doing same duty converting into high level to low level.

compiler do :-
first analyse the source code any syntax error is there its stop the compiler no output...
interpreter do :-
first executing the source code line by line whenever it is find the error it will stop the execution...

advantages:-
**easy to learn and implement.
**
disadvantages:-
**security issues because every browser there is a javascript browser so 
java script code is executing on client side (user computer)might chance of malware attack...
**is it not going to wprk in every browser- browser compatiability issues will come...
